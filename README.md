# Connected Object #1

The first of a series of studies exploring connected objects for my thesis research. This quick experiment sends SMS messages to a liquid crystal display via an Arduino with an ethernet shield.

SMS messages are sent to a php script on my server via twilio.com. The Arduino, using http requests sent via an ethernet shield, connects to my server to get the latest message, which is then displayed on the LCD.

The first in a series of prototyping experiments exploring alternative ways that technology enables us to inhabit spaces.
